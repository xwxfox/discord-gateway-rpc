# TS implementation of Discord's gateway websocket.

Discord dev docs reference: https://discord.com/developers/docs/events/gateway#get-gateway

Far from complete, but it "works"

planning to make a bunch of changes to the way we abstract over the gateway methods to bring them more in line of the DX of things like Discord.JS (maybe)
